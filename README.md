# angular-recipes-app

AngularJS app as an example for templating.

## How to execute

### The Backend

In the folder /backend run:

$ node server.js

The backend is supposed to run in http://localhost:8080

### The Client side

Because I use *bower_components* and haven't minified/compiled the code, we are supposed to run the server one level upper of the /app folder.
